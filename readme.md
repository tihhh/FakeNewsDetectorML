## **Fake News Detection using LSTM**

This repository contains the code and report for a fake news detection project using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. The model was implemented in Python using TensorFlow and Keras and was designed to classify news articles as either real or fake.

#### **Introduction**

This project was made to address the current problem of misinformation by training a machine learning model that is capable of indentifying fake news from news articles. 
Results

#### **Results**

The model achieved:

Accuracy: ~93%

Precision: 92%

Recall: 93%

F1-Score: 0.92 (real news) and 0.93 (fake news)

Graphs of accuracy and loss across epochs showed consistent learning with minor fluctuations.
